# ðŸ“° Detecting Political Bias in Indian News Media using MiniLM

This project demonstrates how to detect political bias in Indian news articles using natural language processing and a fine-tuned transformer model (MiniLM). The goal is to analyze how different media outlets may exhibit ideological leaning â€” left, center, or right â€” based on the language used in headlines and descriptions.
